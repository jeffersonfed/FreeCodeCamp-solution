/*
If you replace 'var' with 'let' in the code above, it results in an error:

let camper = "James";
let camper = "David";
The error can be seen in your browser console.

unlike 'var', when you use 'let', a variable with the same name can only be declared once.

When you declare a variable with the 'var' keyword, it is declared globally, or locally if declared inside a function.


The 'let' keyword behaves similarly, but with some extra features. 
When you declare a variable with the 'let' keyword inside a block, statement, or expression, 
its scope is limited to that block, statement, or expression.
