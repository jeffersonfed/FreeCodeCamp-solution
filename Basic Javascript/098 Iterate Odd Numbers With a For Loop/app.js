/*For loops don't have to iterate one at a time. 
        By changing our final-expression, we can count by even numbers. 
    
        start at i = 0 and loop while i < 10. We'll increment i by 2 each loop with i += 2.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 10; i += 2) {
  ourArray.push(i);
}
ourArray will now contain [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]. 
Let's change our initialization so we can count by odd numbers.
