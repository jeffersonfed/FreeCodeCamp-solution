//two ways to access the properties of an object
        //dot notation (.)
        //bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

        //Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

    //example of using dot notation
    // const myObj = {
    //     prop1: "val1",   
    //     prop2: "val2"    
    //   };
      
    //const prop1val = myObj.prop1;   //prop1val would have a value of the string val1, and 
    //const prop2val = myObj.prop2;   //prop2val would have a value of the string val2.
//testObj using dot notation. 
//Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and 
//set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt.
    
// Setup
const testObj = {
    "hat": "ballcap",
    "shirt": "jersey",
    "shoes": "cleats"
  };
  
  // Only change code below this line
  const hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
  const shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line
